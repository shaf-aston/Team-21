حيث is always a مضاف and its Modaaaf ilayh is always a جملة

single harakat is sign of strong connection since a tanween doesn't come in between a word. So putting a tanween on a modaaf is the same as putting a tanween in the middle of the word. Modaaf becomes ma'rifah from its modaaf ilayh, and it is alone nakirah and only becomes ma'rifah by its modaaf ilayh, so by adding ال to the modaaf causes it to become ma'rifah independently which cannot happen (because it becomes ma'rifah only because of the مضاف اليه being ma'rifah
